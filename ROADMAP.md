# Roadmap

Feel free to reorganize or make suggestions based on what you think is priority and realistic for where the codebase is now.

* Withdraw: as a user I would like withdraw an ammount from my indux fund and have it be applied easily

* Record trades attempted and completed (maybe with influx)

* Scraper stuff
    * Add a script to perform the initial scrape
    * Investigate USD pulling issue 
      * Include `marshall()`, copy line into scraper code, try again

* Optional but nice
    * Replace with proper logging everywhere
    * Auto-withdraw every week
