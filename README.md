# FundRunner

WIP - This will handle trading and backtesting

## install

first, grab the [poloniex ticker database](https://bitbucket.org/peakrider/poloniex-ticker-history) (see that README for how to restore the InfluxDB, which we use for backtesting)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

for an example, see `example.py`
